### Front

What OOP concept refers to the bundling of data and the methods that operate on that data within a single unit?

a) Inheritance  
b) Polymorphism  
c) Encapsulation  
d) Abstraction

### Back

The correct answer is **c) Encapsulation**.

Encapsulation is the bundling of data and the methods that operate on that data within a single unit or object. It provides data hiding and access control to the object's internal state[1](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/oops-interview-questions).

<!-- Card End -->
<!-- Card Start -->

### Front

Which OOP principle allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class?

a) Polymorphism  
b) Encapsulation  
c) Abstraction  
d) Inheritance

### Back

The correct answer is **d) Inheritance**.

Inheritance is a mechanism where a new class is derived from an existing class. The new class (subclass) inherits properties and methods from the existing class (superclass), allowing for code reuse and the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes[1](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/oops-interview-questions).

<!-- Card End --> 
<!-- Card Start -->

### Front

What term describes the ability of different classes to respond to the same method call in different ways?

a) Encapsulation  
b) Polymorphism  
c) Inheritance  
d) Abstraction

### Back

The correct answer is **b) Polymorphism**.

Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables one interface to be used for a general class of actions, with the specific action determined by the exact nature of the situation[1](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/oops-interview-questions).

<!-- Card End --> 
<!-- Card Start -->

### Front

What is a blueprint for creating objects in OOP called?

a) Instance  
b) Method  
c) Class  
d) Function

### Back

The correct answer is **c) Class**.

A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the attributes (data) and methods (functions) that the objects of that class will have. Objects are instances of classes[1](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/oops-interview-questions).

<!-- Card End --> 

<!-- Card Start -->

### Front

What term describes a concrete occurrence of a class?

a) Object  
b) Method  
c) Function  
d) Variable

### Back

The correct answer is **a) Object**.

An object is an instance of a class. It represents a concrete occurrence of the class blueprint, with its own set of data and ability to perform operations defined by the class methods[1](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/oops-interview-questions).

<!-- Card End -->
<!-- Card Start -->

### Front

Which OOP concept refers to the process of hiding the internal details of an object and showing only the functionality?

a) Encapsulation  
b) Inheritance  
c) Polymorphism  
d) Abstraction

### Back

The correct answer is **d) Abstraction**.

Abstraction is the process of hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object. It helps in reducing programming complexity and effort[1](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/oops-interview-questions).

<!-- Card End --> <!-- Card Start -->

### Front

What is the term for a function defined inside a class?

a) Procedure  
b) Method  
c) Routine  
d) Operation

### Back

The correct answer is **b) Method**.

In OOP, a method is a function that is associated with a class. Methods define the behavior of objects and can access and modify the object's data[1](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/oops-interview-questions).

<!-- Card End --> <!-- Card Start -->

### Front

What is the process of creating an object from a class called?

a) Inheritance  
b) Encapsulation  
c) Instantiation  
d) Abstraction

### Back

The correct answer is **c) Instantiation**.

Instantiation is the process of creating an object (instance) from a class. When an object is instantiated, memory is allocated for it, and its constructor is called to initialize its state[1](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/oops-interview-questions).

<!-- Card End --> <!-- Card Start -->

### Front

Which OOP feature allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass?

a) Overloading  
b) Overriding  
c) Hiding  
d) Shadowing

### Back

The correct answer is **b) Overriding**.

Method overriding is a feature that allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. This enables a subclass to inherit from a superclass and modify some of the inherited behaviors[1](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/oops-interview-questions).

<!-- Card End --> 
<!-- Card Start -->

### Front

What is the term for a class that cannot be instantiated and is often used as a base for other classes?

a) Concrete class  
b) Final class  
c) Abstract class  
d) Static class

### Back

The correct answer is **c) Abstract class**.

An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own and is often used as a base for other classes. It may contain abstract methods (methods without a body) that must be implemented by its subclasses[1](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/oops-interview-questions).

<!-- Card End -->
<!-- Card Start -->

### Front

Which access modifier makes a class member accessible only within the same class?

a) public  
b) protected  
c) private  
d) default

### Back

The correct answer is **c) private**.

The private access modifier restricts the visibility of a class member (variable or method) to only within the same class. This is a key aspect of encapsulation, as it helps in hiding the internal details of a class[1](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/oops-interview-questions).

<!-- Card End --> 

<!-- Card Start -->

### Front

What is the term for a class that inherits from another class?

a) Parent class  
b) Superclass  
c) Base class  
d) Subclass

### Back

The correct answer is **d) Subclass**.

A subclass (also known as a derived class or child class) is a class that inherits properties and methods from another class (its superclass or parent class). This relationship is part of the inheritance principle in OOP[1](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/oops-interview-questions).

<!-- Card End --> <!-- Card Start -->

### Front

Which OOP concept allows a single method to have different implementations depending on the type of object it is called on?

a) Method overloading  
b) Method overriding  
c) Dynamic dispatch  
d) Static binding

### Back

The correct answer is **c) Dynamic dispatch**.

Dynamic dispatch (also known as dynamic binding or late binding) is a mechanism in OOP where the method being called is determined at runtime based on the actual type of the object. This is a key aspect of polymorphism[1](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/oops-interview-questions).

<!-- Card End --> <!-- Card Start -->

### Front

What is the term for a special method that is automatically called when an object is created?

a) Finalizer  
b) Initializer  
c) Constructor  
d) Destructor

### Back

The correct answer is **c) Constructor**.

A constructor is a special method in a class that is automatically called when an object of that class is created. It is used to initialize the object's state and allocate resources if needed[1](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/oops-interview-questions).

<!-- Card End --> <!-- Card Start -->

### Front

Which OOP principle aims to reduce the complexity of software design by hiding unnecessary details?

a) Encapsulation  
b) Inheritance  
c) Polymorphism  
d) Abstraction

### Back

The correct answer is **d) Abstraction**.

Abstraction in OOP aims to reduce complexity by hiding unnecessary details and exposing only the essential features of an object. This allows developers to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it[1](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/oops-interview-questions).

<!-- Card End --> <!-- Card Start -->

### Front

What is the term for a class that cannot be inherited from?

a) Abstract class  
b) Final class  
c) Sealed class  
d) Static class

### Back

The correct answer is **b) Final class**.

A final class (also known as a sealed class in some languages) is a class that cannot be inherited from. This is used when you want to prevent further specialization of a class[1](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/oops-interview-questions).

<!-- Card End --> <!-- Card Start -->

### Front

Which OOP concept allows a class to have multiple methods with the same name but different parameters?

a) Polymorphism  
b) Encapsulation  
c) Method overloading  
d) Method overriding

### Back

The correct answer is **c) Method overloading**.

Method overloading is a feature of OOP that allows a class to have multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. This is a form of compile-time polymorphism, as the correct method to call is determined at compile time based on the method signature[1](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/oops-interview-questions).

<!-- Card End --> <!-- Card Start -->

### Front

What is the term for a variable that belongs to a class rather than an instance of the class?

a) Instance variable  
b) Class variable  
c) Static variable  
d) Global variable

### Back

The correct answer is **c) Static variable**.

A static variable (also known as a class variable) is a variable that belongs to the class itself rather than to any specific instance of the class. It is shared by all instances of the class and can be accessed without creating an object of the class[1](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/oops-interview-questions).

<!-- Card Start -->

### Front

**What does it mean that Java is a class-based language?**

### Back

Java is **class-based**, meaning that every piece of code is defined within a class. This structure encourages object-oriented programming by organizing code into blueprints for creating objects.

<!-- Card End --> <!-- Card Start -->

### Front

**What is the significance of the `public static void main(String[] args)` method in Java?**

### Back

The `public static void main(String[] args)` method is the entry point of a Java application.

- **public:** Accessible from anywhere.
- **static:** Can be called without creating an instance of the class.
- **void:** Returns no value.
- **main:** Name of the method that the JVM looks for to start execution.
- **String[] args:** Accepts command-line arguments.

<!-- Card End --> <!-- Card Start -->

### Front

**What is a Class in Object-Oriented Programming?**

### Back

A **class** is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines a user-defined data type that encapsulates data (fields) and behavior (methods), serving as a template for similar objects.

<!-- Card End --> <!-- Card Start -->

### Front

**What is an Object in Object-Oriented Programming?**

### Back

An **object** is an instance of a class. It represents a concrete entity that holds state (data) and behavior (methods) defined by its class, allowing interaction in a program.

<!-- Card End --> <!-- Card Start -->

### Front

**What is Inheritance in Java?**

### Back

**Inheritance** is a mechanism where a new class (subclass) derives properties and behavior (fields and methods) from an existing class (superclass). It promotes code reuse and establishes a relationship between classes.

<!-- Card End --> <!-- Card Start -->

### Front

**What is Polymorphism in Object-Oriented Programming?**

### Back

**Polymorphism** allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class. There are two types:

- **Compile-time (static) polymorphism:** Achieved via method overloading.
- **Runtime (dynamic) polymorphism:** Achieved via method overriding.

<!-- Card End --> <!-- Card Start -->

### Front

**What is Method Overloading in Java?**

### Back

**Method overloading** occurs when multiple methods in the same class share the same name but have different parameters (type, number, or both). It represents compile-time polymorphism, allowing different implementations based on arguments.

<!-- Card End --> <!-- Card Start -->

### Front

**What is Method Overriding in Java?**

### Back

**Method overriding** occurs when a subclass provides its own implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. This supports runtime polymorphism, where the method to be executed is determined at runtime.

<!-- Card End --> <!-- Card Start -->

### Front

**What is a Virtual Function in Java?**

### Back

In Java, every public, non-static, and non-final method is a virtual function. This means that methods can be overridden in subclasses, enabling dynamic method dispatch and runtime polymorphism.

<!-- Card End --> <!-- Card Start -->

### Front

**What is an Interface in Java?**

### Back

An **interface** in Java is a reference type that can contain only abstract methods (until default methods were introduced) and constants. It specifies a contract which implementing classes must fulfill, without providing method implementations.

<!-- Card End --> <!-- Card Start -->

### Front

**What is Abstraction in Object-Oriented Programming?**

### Back

**Abstraction** involves hiding the complex implementation details of a system and exposing only the necessary parts. In Java, abstraction is achieved through abstract classes and interfaces, allowing programmers to focus on interactions at a higher level.

<!-- Card End --> <!-- Card Start -->

### Front

**What is Encapsulation in Java?**

### Back

**Encapsulation** is the process of bundling data (fields) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, i.e., a class. It also restricts direct access to some of an object's components, promoting data hiding and security.

<!-- Card End --> <!-- Card Start -->

### Front

**What are Access Specifiers in Java?**

### Back

**Access specifiers** (or modifiers) determine the visibility of classes, methods, and variables. The primary ones are:

- **public:** Accessible from any other class.
- **private:** Accessible only within its own class.
- **protected:** Accessible within the same package and subclasses in other packages.

<!-- Card End --> <!-- Card Start -->

### Front

**What is the difference between Instance Variables and Class Variables in Java?**

### Back

- **Instance Variables:** Belong to an instance of a class. Each object has its own copy.
- **Class Variables (static variables):** Belong to the class itself and are shared across all instances.

<!-- Card End --> 
<!-- Card Start -->

### Front

**What does the `static` keyword signify in Java?**

### Back

The **static** keyword indicates that a variable or method belongs to the class rather than any instance. This allows access without instantiating the class and ensures a single copy for all objects.

<!-- Card End --> 
<!-- Card Start -->

### Front

**What is the role of the `final` keyword in Java?**

### Back

The **final** keyword can be applied to variables, methods, and classes:

- **Final Variables:** Once assigned, cannot be changed.
- **Final Methods:** Cannot be overridden by subclasses.
- **Final Classes:** Cannot be subclassed.

<!-- Card End --> 
<!-- Card Start -->

### Front

**What is an Abstract Class in Java?**

### Back

An **abstract class** cannot be instantiated on its own and may contain abstract methods (without implementation) alongside concrete methods. It serves as a base class for other classes to extend and implement the abstract methods.

<!-- Card End --> <!-- Card Start -->

### Front

**How does an Abstract Class differ from an Interface in Java?**

### Back

- **Abstract Class:** Can have both abstract and concrete methods, state (fields), and constructors.
- **Interface:** Primarily a contract with abstract methods (or default methods in newer versions) and constants, with no state or constructors.

<!-- Card End --> <!-- Card Start -->

### Front

**What is the Java Virtual Machine (JVM)?**

### Back

The **JVM** is an abstract computing machine that enables a computer to run a Java program. It converts compiled bytecode into machine code, ensuring platform independence by interpreting the same bytecode on any device with a JVM.

<!-- Card End --> <!-- Card Start -->

### Front

**What is the Java Runtime Environment (JRE)?**

### Back

The **JRE** provides the libraries, Java Virtual Machine (JVM), and other components to run applications written in Java. It does not include development tools like compilers or debuggers.

<!-- Card End --> <!-- Card Start -->

### Front

**What is the Java Development Kit (JDK)?**

### Back

The **JDK** is a complete package for Java development. It includes the JRE, a compiler, a debugger, and various tools needed to develop, compile, and run Java applications.

<!-- Card End --> <!-- Card Start -->

### Front

**What is Bytecode in Java?**

### Back

**Bytecode** is the intermediate representation of Java code compiled from source code. It is platform-independent and executed by the JVM, which translates it into machine-specific code.

<!-- Card End --> <!-- Card Start -->

### Front

**How does Java achieve platform independence?**

### Back

Java achieves platform independence by compiling source code into bytecode, which the JVM interprets or compiles just-in-time for any hardware architecture, making Java programs "write once, run anywhere."

<!-- Card End --> <!-- Card Start -->

### Front

**What is a Constructor in Java?**

### Back

A **constructor** is a special method used to initialize objects when they are created. It has the same name as the class and no return type, and it sets up initial state or performs setup tasks.

<!-- Card End --> <!-- Card Start -->

### Front

**What is a Method Signature in Java?**

### Back

A **method signature** includes the method's name and its parameter list (types and order). It is used by the compiler to differentiate between methods (e.g., in method overloading).

<!-- Card End --> <!-- Card Start -->

### Front

**What is Exception Handling in Java?**

### Back

**Exception handling** is the process of managing runtime errors. It involves using **try-catch-finally** blocks to catch exceptions, handle errors gracefully, and ensure resources are released properly.

<!-- Card End --> <!-- Card Start -->

### Front

**What is the purpose of a try-catch block in Java?**

### Back

A **try-catch block** is used to enclose code that might throw an exception. If an exception occurs, the catch block executes to handle it, preventing the program from crashing.

<!-- Card End --> <!-- Card Start -->

### Front

**What is the role of the finally block in Java?**

### Back

The **finally block** contains code that always executes after the try and catch blocks, regardless of whether an exception was thrown. It is typically used for cleanup operations like closing files or releasing resources.

<!-- Card End --> <!-- Card Start -->

### Front

**What is a Package in Java?**

### Back

A **package** in Java is a namespace that organizes a set of related classes and interfaces. It helps avoid naming conflicts and makes it easier to locate and maintain code.

<!-- Card End --> <!-- Card Start -->

### Front

**What is the purpose of the import statement in Java?**

### Back

The **import** statement allows classes and interfaces from other packages to be accessible in your code without needing to specify their full package names, simplifying code readability and maintenance.

<!-- Card End --> <!-- Card Start -->

### Front

**What is the use of the `this` keyword in Java?**

### Back

The **this** keyword refers to the current instance of a class. It is used to distinguish between instance variables and parameters, and to invoke other constructors in the same class.

<!-- Card End --> <!-- Card Start -->

### Front

**What is the use of the `super` keyword in Java?**

### Back

The **super** keyword is used to refer to the immediate parent class. It helps access superclass methods and constructors, particularly when they are overridden in the subclass.

<!-- Card End --> <!-- Card Start -->

### Front

**How does Java support Encapsulation?**

### Back

Java supports encapsulation by using **access specifiers** to restrict access to class members and by bundling data (fields) with methods that operate on that data. This promotes data integrity and hides internal implementation details.

<!-- Card End --> <!-- Card Start -->

### Front

**What is the role of access modifiers in Object-Oriented Programming?**

### Back

Access modifiers (public, private, protected) control the visibility of classes, methods, and variables. They are essential for encapsulation, ensuring that an object's internal state is not exposed or modified unexpectedly.

<!-- Card End --> <!-- Card Start -->

### Front

**What is the difference between static methods and instance methods in Java?**

### Back

- **Static Methods:** Belong to the class and can be called without creating an instance. They cannot access instance variables directly.
- **Instance Methods:** Belong to an object and require an instance of the class to be invoked, with access to the instance’s data.
