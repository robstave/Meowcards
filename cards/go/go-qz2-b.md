Which of the following best describes Go's error handling philosophy?

A) Try-catch exception handling
B) Return error values that must be explicitly checked
C) Global error callbacks
D) Panic as the primary error mechanism

### Back

**B) Return error values that must be explicitly checked**

Go uses explicit error checking through returned error values rather than exceptions, making error paths explicit in code and encouraging proper error handling. This approach makes control flow clearer and improves maintainability.

What is the main benefit of Go's defer statement?

A) It improves performance by delaying execution
B) It guarantees resource cleanup regardless of execution path
C) It allows dynamic function definition
D) It automatically retries failed operations

### Back

**B) It guarantees resource cleanup regardless of execution path**

The `defer` statement ensures that cleanup code runs before a function returns, even if there are multiple return statements or panics. This pattern significantly reduces resource leaks by pairing resource acquisition with immediate deferred cleanup.

Which statement best characterizes Go's approach to generics?

A) Available since Go 1.0 with full template metaprogramming
B) Added in Go 1.18 with a focus on type safety and readability
C) Not supported as interfaces provide sufficient abstraction
D) Implemented through the reflect package for dynamic typing

### Back

**B) Added in Go 1.18 with a focus on type safety and readability**

Go 1.18 introduced generics with type parameters that provide compile-time type safety while preserving readability and build speed. The implementation favors clarity and simplicity over complex features like specialization or metaprogramming found in other languages.

What is the main architectural benefit of Go's module system?

A) It enforces monolithic application structure
B) It provides versioned dependencies with minimal version conflicts
C) It eliminates the need for third-party libraries
D) It dynamically loads code at runtime

### Back

**B) It provides versioned dependencies with minimal version conflicts**

Go modules (introduced in Go 1.11) solve dependency management by supporting versioned imports with semantic versioning, minimal version selection algorithm, and reproducible builds through go.mod files. This gives projects reliable, consistent dependencies without dependency hell.

How does Go's CSP-based concurrency model differ from actor-based concurrency?

A) CSP uses shared memory, actors use message passing
B) CSP separates communication channels from processing entities
C) CSP only allows synchronous communication
D) CSP requires more threads than actor models

### Back

**B) CSP separates communication channels from processing entities**

**CSP (Communicating Sequential Processes)** is a concurrency model where processes (goroutines in Go) communicate by passing messages through channels, rather than sharing memory. This model emphasizes:

- **Message Passing**: Processes interact by sending and receiving messages over channels, avoiding shared state and reducing the risk of race conditions.
- **Channel as First-Class Citizen**: Channels are independent of the processes, allowing multiple goroutines to communicate flexibly.
- **Synchronization**: Sending and receiving on unbuffered channels is synchronous, ensuring coordination between goroutines.

**Comparison to Actor Model**:
- In the actor model, each actor has its own mailbox for receiving messages, tightly coupling communication to the actor.
- CSP's decoupling of channels from processes allows for more dynamic and reusable communication patterns, such as broadcasting or load balancing across multiple goroutines.

This separation in CSP enables Go to efficiently handle concurrent workloads with clear and predictable communication patterns.

Which of these is NOT a design goal of Go's compilation strategy?

A) Fast compilation times
B) Simple dependency analysis
C) Single static binary output
D) Just-in-time optimization

### Back

**D) Just-in-time optimization**

Go is designed for fast compilation to machine code with straightforward dependency analysis, producing self-contained binaries. It deliberately avoids just-in-time compilation, prioritizing predictable performance and deployment simplicity over runtime optimizations.

Which memory model does Go implement?

A) Strong sequential consistency
B) Relaxed memory ordering with happens-before relationships
C) Lock-free programming for all data structures
D) Total memory isolation between goroutines

### Back

**B) Relaxed memory ordering with happens-before relationships**

Go's memory model defines when reads can observe writes through specific "happens-before" relationships, particularly around channel operations, locks, and the atomic package. This balance allows compiler/hardware optimizations while giving programmers clear rules for concurrent access.

### Front

What is the key benefit of Go's interface implementation being implicit?

A) It encourages composition over inheritance
B) It enables higher performance by avoiding virtual tables
C) It allows loose coupling between packages without direct dependencies
D) It simplifies reflection operations

### Back

**C) It allows loose coupling between packages without direct dependencies**

**Implicit vs Explicit Interface Implementation**:
- **Implicit**: In Go, a type satisfies an interface simply by implementing its methods. There is no need to explicitly declare that a type implements an interface. This reduces boilerplate code and allows for more flexible and decoupled designs.
- **Explicit**: In languages like Java or C#, a type must explicitly declare that it implements an interface (e.g., `implements InterfaceName`). This creates a direct dependency between the type and the interface, which can make code less flexible.

**Why Not A (Encourages Composition Over Inheritance)?**:
- While Go does encourage composition over inheritance, this is not directly related to its implicit interface implementation.
- Composition is achieved through embedding and struct design, whereas implicit interfaces focus on decoupling and reducing dependencies between packages.
- Option A conflates two separate design principles in Go, making it incorrect in this context.

Which statement best describes Go's approach to metaprogramming?

A) Extensive compile-time code generation through go generate
B) Reflection-based runtime metaprogramming
C) Template-based metaprogramming through generics
D) Macro system similar to Lisp

### Back

**A) Extensive compile-time code generation through go generate**

Go favors compile-time code generation (via `go generate`) over runtime reflection or complex template systems, allowing tools to generate type-safe code that performs well and can be reviewed before compilation.

What is the significance of Go's work stealing scheduler?

A) It allows goroutines to be migrated between OS threads
B) It provides cooperative rather than preemptive scheduling
C) It optimizes CPU cache usage through processor affinity
D) It enables goroutines to have priorities

### Back

**A) It allows goroutines to be migrated between OS threads**

Go's work-stealing scheduler efficiently distributes goroutines across available OS threads (M:N scheduling model), allowing idle threads to "steal" work from busy threads' queues. This maximizes CPU utilization and adapts to varying workloads dynamically.

Which design principle guides the Go standard library's API design?

A) Complete abstraction of all underlying operations
B) Extensibility through subclassing
C) Minimal, orthogonal interfaces that compose well
D) Maximum flexibility through configuration options

### Back

**C) Minimal, orthogonal interfaces that compose well**

Go's standard library favors small, focused interfaces (like io.Reader and io.Writer) that can be composed to build more complex behavior. This approach provides flexibility through composition rather than complex inheritance hierarchies or configuration.

What aspect of Go was specifically designed to improve long-term code maintainability?

A) Enforced code formatting through gofmt
B) Prohibition of unused imports and variables
C) Limited number of keywords
D) All of the above

### Back

**D) All of the above**

Go was designed with maintainability as a primary goal, using enforced formatting (gofmt), strict compile-time checks for unused code, and a deliberately limited language specification to reduce "code rot" and make large codebases manageable over time.

Why does Go use a package-level visibility model (exported/unexported) rather than traditional access modifiers (public/private/protected)?

A) To improve compilation speed
B) To force better package organization and API design
C) To maintain backward compatibility with C
D) To reduce typing by avoiding keywords

### Back

**B) To force better package organization and API design**

Go's visibility model (capitalized for exported, lowercase for unexported) operates at the package level rather than class level, encouraging developers to organize code into cohesive packages with well-defined APIs and internal implementations.

What is the primary advantage of Go's static linking approach?

A) Smaller binary sizes
B) Deployment simplicity with minimal dependencies
C) Better security through reduced attack surface
D) Faster runtime performance

### Back

**B) Deployment simplicity with minimal dependencies**

Go typically produces statically linked binaries that include all dependencies, making deployment simpler and more reliable - applications can be copied to target systems and run without installing runtime dependencies or worrying about version conflicts.

How does adding a `default` case affect a `select` statement in Go?

A) It makes the select statement terminate immediately
B) It makes the select statement non-blocking
C) It prevents the select statement from handling multiple channels
D) It forces the select statement to prioritize certain channels

### Back

**B) It makes the select statement non-blocking**

Without a `default` case, a `select` statement blocks until one of its cases can proceed. Adding a `default` case makes it non-blocking - if no channel operations are ready, the `default` case executes immediately instead of waiting.

```go
// Non-blocking select with default
select {
case msg := <-ch:
    fmt.Println("Received:", msg)
default:
    fmt.Println("No message available")
    // Continues execution immediately if ch is not ready
}
```

Which is the correct way to implement a timeout for a channel operation using `select`?

A) `timeout(ch, 500)`
B) `select { case timeout(1000): ... }`
C) `select { case <-time.After(time.Second): ... }`
D) `ch.setTimeout(1000)`

### Back

**C) `select { case <-time.After(time.Second): ... }`**

The idiomatic way to implement a timeout in Go is by using the `time.After` function within a `select` statement. It returns a channel that will send a value after the specified duration, allowing you to handle timeouts elegantly:

```go
select {
case data := <-ch:
    // Process the data
case <-time.After(time.Second):
    // Timeout occurred after waiting for 1 second
    fmt.Println("Operation timed out")
}
```

What happens when multiple cases in a `select` statement are ready simultaneously?

A) The first case in the source code is always chosen
B) The case with the highest priority is chosen
C) A case is chosen pseudo-randomly with uniform distribution
D) All ready cases are executed in parallel

### Back

**C) A case is chosen pseudo-randomly with uniform distribution**

When multiple cases in a `select` statement are ready simultaneously, Go selects one at random with uniform probability. This prevents channel starvation and ensures fairness, but means execution can be non-deterministic when multiple channels are ready at the same time.

What is the behavior of an empty `select` statement with no cases?

A) It compiles but panics at runtime
B) It causes a compile-time error
C) It blocks forever
D) It returns immediately

### Back

**C) It blocks forever**

An empty `select` statement (`select {}`) blocks forever with no possibility of unblocking. This pattern is sometimes used deliberately at the end of the `main` function to prevent the program from exiting while goroutines continue to run in the background.

```go
// This will block forever
select {}
```

### Front

What is the key difference between `switch` statements and `select` statements in Go?

A) `switch` works with any data type, while `select` works only with channels
B) `switch` evaluates cases sequentially, while `select` evaluates all cases simultaneously
C) `select` allows fallthrough but `switch` doesn't
D) `switch` requires a default case, but `select` doesn't

### Back

**A) `switch` works with any data type, while `select` works only with channels**

The fundamental difference is that `switch` is designed for conditional branching based on values of any type, while `select` is specifically designed for channel operations:

- `switch` evaluates a value and executes the first matching case
- `select` waits for channel operations and executes whichever case is ready first

`select` can only be used with channel operations (send or receive), making it specialized for concurrent programming.

How do `switch` statements and `select` statements differ in their execution when multiple cases match?

A) Both execute all matching cases in order
B) Both execute only the first matching case
C) `switch` executes the first matching case, while `select` chooses randomly among ready cases
D) Both statements require the use of `fallthrough` to execute multiple cases

### Back

**C) `switch` executes the first matching case, while `select` chooses randomly among ready cases**

This represents a fundamental difference in how the two statements handle multiple matches:

- In a `switch` statement, cases are evaluated from top to bottom, and only the first matching case is executed (unless `fallthrough` is used)
- In a `select` statement, if multiple channels are ready simultaneously, one case is chosen at random with uniform probability

This difference reflects their different purposes: `switch` for deterministic conditional branching, and `select` for handling concurrent, non-deterministic channel operations.

When should you prefer channels over mutexes in Go?

A) When you need the absolute highest performance  
B) When the problem naturally models communication between goroutines  
C) When working with a large number of shared variables  
D) When you need to modify complex data structures concurrently

### Back

**B) When the problem naturally models communication between goroutines**

Channels are ideal when:
- You're passing ownership of data between goroutines
- You need to signal events or completion (e.g., done signals)
- You're implementing pipeline or fan-out/fan-in patterns
- You want to limit concurrency (e.g., worker pools with limited size)

Channels encapsulate both the data and synchronization, making them perfect for scenarios where goroutines need to coordinate by passing messages rather than by sharing state.

Example:
```go
func worker(jobs <-chan Job, results chan<- Result) {
    for job := range jobs {
        results <- process(job)
    }
}
```

### Front

In which scenario would mutexes be more appropriate than channels in Go?

A) When implementing a signaling system between goroutines  
B) When coordinating the start and stop of multiple goroutines  
C) When protecting shared state that's frequently accessed  
D) When implementing a producer-consumer pattern

### Back

**C) When protecting shared state that's frequently accessed**

Mutexes are more appropriate when:
- Multiple goroutines need read/write access to shared data
- Performance is critical (mutexes have less overhead than channels)
- The shared state is updated in place rather than passed between goroutines
- Fine-grained locking is needed

Example:
```go
type Counter struct {
    mu    sync.Mutex
    count int
}

func (c *Counter) Increment() {
    c.mu.Lock()
    c.count++
    c.mu.Unlock()
}

func (c *Counter) Value() int {
    c.mu.Lock()
    defer c.mu.Unlock()
    return c.count
}
```

### Front

Which of the following is a valid hybrid approach combining channels and mutexes in Go?

A) Using channels for signaling and mutexes for protecting shared state  
B) Using mutexes inside channels for double protection  
C) Using channels to synchronize access to mutexes  
D) Using atomic operations to protect channels

### Back

**A) Using channels for signaling and mutexes for protecting shared state**

A common and effective pattern in Go combines:
- Channels for coordination, signaling, and coarse-grained communication
- Mutexes for protecting internal state or data structures

This hybrid approach uses each synchronization primitive for what it does best:

```go
type Worker struct {
    jobs    chan Job
    results chan Result
    cache   map[string]Result
    mu      sync.Mutex // Protects the cache
}

func (w *Worker) Process() {
    for job := range w.jobs {
        // Check cache with mutex protection
        w.mu.Lock()
        result, found := w.cache[job.ID]
        w.mu.Unlock()
        
        if found {
            w.results <- result
            continue
        }
        
        // Process job
        result = processJob(job)
        
        // Update cache with mutex protection
        w.mu.Lock()
        w.cache[job.ID] = result
        w.mu.Unlock()
        
        // Send result via channel
        w.results <- result
    }
}
```

This approach is often seen in well-designed Go libraries and services, combining the best aspects of both synchronization mechanisms.

What is duck typing, and how does it relate to Go's type system?

A) A way to define types explicitly  
B) A method of type inference based on method signatures  
C) A mechanism for runtime type checking  
D) A feature for dynamic typing in Go

### Back

**B) A method of type inference based on method signatures**

Duck typing is a concept where the type of an object is determined by the methods it implements, rather than its explicit declaration. The name comes from the saying, "If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck."

**Duck Typing in Go**:
- Go uses duck typing through its interface system.
- A type satisfies an interface if it implements all the methods defined by the interface, without needing explicit declaration.
- This allows for loose coupling and flexible code, as types can satisfy interfaces without knowing about them.

**Example**:
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

type Quacker interface {
	Quack()
}

type Duck struct{}

func (d Duck) Quack() {
	fmt.Println("Quack!")
}

func MakeItQuack1(q Quacker) {
	q.Quack()
}

func MakeItQuack2(d Duck) {
	d.Quack()
}

func main() {
	var d Duck
	MakeItQuack1(d) // Duck satisfies Quacker because it implements Quack()
	MakeItQuack2(d) // Duck just works...this is not ducking
}

```

https://go.dev/play/p/6g8huL8W9Oi

In this example, `Duck` satisfies the `Quacker` interface because it implements the `Quack` method, even though it doesn't explicitly declare that it implements `Quacker`. This is a practical demonstration of duck typing in Go.

However, `MakeItQuack2` is not an example of duck typing. It explicitly requires a `Duck` type as its parameter, which means it does not rely on the interface system or method signatures to determine compatibility. Instead, it directly couples the function to the `Duck` type, losing the flexibility and loose coupling that duck typing provides.
