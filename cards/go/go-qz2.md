What is the primary design philosophy behind Go's error handling?

A) Errors should be hidden from developers
B) Explicit error handling over exceptions
C) Automatic error recovery

What makes Go's goroutines more efficient than traditional OS threads?

A) They run on the GPU
B) They use less memory and have faster context switching
C) They can only run one at a time
D) They automatically handle errors

### Back

**B) They use less memory and have faster context switching**

Goroutines start with only 2KB of stack space (vs 2MB for OS threads) and are multiplexed onto OS threads by the Go runtime, making context switching much faster.

**Traditional OS Threads**:
- Heavy memory footprint: Each thread starts with 2MB of stack space.
- Expensive creation: Involves system calls and kernel management.
- High context switching cost: Requires saving/restoring CPU registers, switching memory spaces, and updating kernel data structures.
- Limited scalability: Typically supports thousands of threads before performance degrades.

**Goroutines**:
- Lightweight: Start with only 2KB of stack space.
- Fast creation: Created as simple function calls.
- Efficient scheduling: Many goroutines are multiplexed onto fewer OS threads by the Go runtime.
- Massive scalability: Can handle hundreds of thousands or even millions of goroutines efficiently.

What makes Go's concurrency model different from async/await patterns?

A) Go uses callbacks
B) Goroutines and channels provide CSP-style communication
C) Go is single-threaded
D) Go uses promises

### Back

**B) Goroutines and channels provide CSP-style communication**

Go implements Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP), where independent goroutines communicate through channels, rather than async/await's promise-based approach.

**B) CSP separates communication channels from processing entities**

**CSP (Communicating Sequential Processes)** is a concurrency model where processes (goroutines in Go) communicate by passing messages through channels, rather than sharing memory. This model emphasizes:

- **Message Passing**: Processes interact by sending and receiving messages over channels, avoiding shared state and reducing the risk of race conditions.
- **Channel as First-Class Citizen**: Channels are independent of the processes, allowing multiple goroutines to communicate flexibly.
- **Synchronization**: Sending and receiving on unbuffered channels is synchronous, ensuring coordination between goroutines.

**Comparison to Actor Model**:
- In the actor model, each actor has its own mailbox for receiving messages, tightly coupling communication to the actor.
- CSP's decoupling of channels from processes allows for more dynamic and reusable communication patterns, such as broadcasting or load balancing across multiple goroutines.

This separation in CSP enables Go to efficiently handle concurrent workloads with clear and predictable communication patterns.

Which aspect of Go's design best addresses the "billion dollar mistake" (null reference errors)?

A) Panic and recover mechanism
B) Pointers without pointer arithmetic
C) Zero values and explicit nil checks
D) Garbage collection

### Back

**C) Zero values and explicit nil checks**

Go addresses Tony Hoare's "billion dollar mistake" (null references) through a combination of zero values (making uninitialized variables usable) and explicit nil checks that force developers to handle nil cases, reducing unexpected nil pointer dereference errors.
