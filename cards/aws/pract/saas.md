### Front

**What is the primary characteristic of the On-Premises deployment model regarding customer responsibility?**

- Hint: Think about who manages the entire infrastructure stack.

### Back

In the **On-Premises** deployment model, the **customer has full responsibility** for all aspects of the infrastructure, including:

- Applications
- Customer data
- Runtime
- Middleware
- Operating system
- Virtualization
- Networking
- Storage
- Servers

The provider has **no responsibility** in this model.

### Front

**Which components are managed by the customer in the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) model?**

- Hint: Responsibilities extend up to the operating system.

### Back

In the **IaaS** model, the customer is responsible for:

- Applications
- Customer data
- Runtime
- Middleware
- Operating system

The provider manages:

- Virtualization
- Networking
- Storage
- Servers

<!-- Card End -->

<!-- Card Start -->

### Front

**What responsibilities does the customer have in the Platform as a Service (PaaS) model?**

- Hint: Focus on what's unique to their business.

### Back

In the **PaaS** model, the customer is responsible for:

- Applications
- Customer data

- Storage
- Servers

<!-- Card End -->

<!-- Card Start -->

### Front

**In the Software as a Service (SaaS) model, what is the customer's responsibility?**


### Back

In the **SaaS** model, the customer has **no responsibility** for managing the infrastructure or software components. The provider manages everything, including:

- Applications
- Customer data
- Runtime
- Middleware
- Operating system
- Virtualization
- Networking
- Storage
- Servers

<!-- Card End -->

### Front

**List the four main cloud service models in order of increasing provider responsibility.**

### Back

1. **On-Premises** (Full customer responsibility)
2. **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**
3. **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**
4. **Software as a Service (SaaS)** (Full provider responsibility)

<!-- Card End -->

<!-- Card Start -->

### Front

**Explain the Shared Responsibility Model in AWS.**

 

### Back

The **Shared Responsibility Model** divides responsibilities between AWS and the customer:

- **AWS** is responsible for the security **of** the cloud (infrastructure, hardware, software, networking, and facilities).
- **Customers** are responsible for security **in** the cloud (customer data, applications, identity and access management, encryption).

<!-- Card End -->

<!-- Card Start -->

### Front

**Which AWS services are examples of IaaS offerings?**

 

### Back

Examples of AWS **IaaS** services:

- **Amazon EC2** (Elastic Compute Cloud)
- **Amazon VPC** (Virtual Private Cloud)
- **Amazon EBS** (Elastic Block Store)

These services provide foundational infrastructure resources.

<!-- Card End -->

<!-- Card Start -->

### Front

**Name AWS services that are categorized under PaaS.**

### Back

Examples of AWS **PaaS** services:

- **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**
- **AWS Lambda**
- **Amazon RDS** (Relational Database Service)

These services enable application deployment without infrastructure management.

<!-- Card End -->

<!-- Card Start -->

### Front

**Identify AWS services that are considered SaaS offerings.**


### Back

Examples of AWS **SaaS** services:

- **Amazon WorkSpaces**
- **Amazon Chime**
- **Amazon QuickSight**

These are fully managed applications delivered via the cloud.

### Front

**Why might a company choose PaaS over IaaS?**

- Hint: Consider development efficiency and resource management.

### Back

A company might choose **PaaS** over **IaaS** because:

- It allows developers to focus on application development without managing underlying infrastructure.
- Reduces time to market by handling runtime, middleware, and operating systems.
- Offers scalability and simplified deployment.

### Front

**In which cloud service model does the provider manage up to the virtualization layer, leaving the rest to the customer?**

- Hint: It's one step above On-Premises in provider responsibility.

### Back

This describes the **IaaS** (Infrastructure as a Service) model. The provider manages:

- Virtualization
- Networking
- Storage
- Servers

The customer manages everything above, including:

- Operating system
- Middleware
- Runtime
