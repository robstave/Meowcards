Lets create some cards on Microservice patterns.  In some cases it can be multiple choices on which pattern does what.  Others with what functions are part of the pattern.

- Api Gateway
- Circuit Breaker
- Strangler Fig
- Event sourcing
- Saga
- Bulkhead
- Database per service
- Service discovery
- CQRS
- Sidecar
- transactional outbox pattern
- backends for frontends
- service registry  


there can be cards that are not multiple choice too....just Describe < pattern >

for saga, go into orchestrator vs choreography

I probably missed some too

there are some deployment patterns too like blue green, canary, rolling update, etc. 

we can talk about service mesh a bit

also  horizontal scaling,  load balancing,  etc.





## other cards

Microservices - also known as the microservice architecture - is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of two or more services that are:

Independently deployable
Loosely coupled
Services are typically organized around business capabilities. Each service is often owned by a single, small team.
